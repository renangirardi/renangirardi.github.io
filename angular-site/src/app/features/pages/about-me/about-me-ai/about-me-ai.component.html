      My curiosity for new technologies led me, at the end of 2022,
      to start experimenting with Generative AI tools, beginning with
      <span class="chatgpt">ChatGPT</span>. Since then, this universe has become part of my daily
      life, transforming the way I study, work, and create. Over time,
      I’ve explored tools such as <span class="gemini">Gemini</span>, <span class="claude">Claude</span>, <span class="github-copilot">GitHub Copilot</span>, <span class="windsurf">Windsurf</span>,
      <span class="stable-diffusion">Stable Diffusion</span>, <span class="midjourney">Midjourney</span>, and <span class="dall-e">DALL·E</span>. Each of them has shown me
      new ways to boost productivity, accelerate learning, and bring
      creative ideas to life.

      But my relationship with GenAI goes beyond practical use. It has
      also been a space to play and have fun. I created the Instagram
      account <span class="cthulhu">&commat;ai.cthulhu</span>, a project with no professional intent,
      just a way to share funny images I make together with friends.
      In these creations, <span class="cthulhu">Cthulhu</span>, the classic monster from H. P. Lovecraft’s
      literature and an iconic figure in board games like <span class="cthulhu">Eldritch Horror</span>,
      which we often played, shows up in unlikely situations: grocery shopping,
      starring in famous movies, or living everyday moments.
